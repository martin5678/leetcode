Validate if a given string is numeric.

Some examples:
"0" => true
" 0.1 " => true
"abc" => false
"1 a" => false
"2e10" => true
Note: It is intended for the problem statement to be ambiguous. You should gather all requirements up front before implementing one.



Note:

This function attempts to decompose string as follows:

A (possibly empty) sequence of whitespace characters. Which characters are whitespace is determined by the isspace function (see Classification of Characters). These are discarded.

An optional plus or minus sign (¡®+¡¯ or ¡®-¡¯).

A floating point number in decimal. The decimal format is:

***A nonempty sequence of digits optionally containing a decimal-point character¡ªnormally ¡®.¡¯, but it depends on the locale (see General Numeric).

***An optional exponent part, consisting of a character ¡®e¡¯ or ¡®E¡¯, an optional sign, and a sequence of digits.
