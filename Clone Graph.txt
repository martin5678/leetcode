Clone an undirected graph. Each node in the graph contains a label and a list of its neighbors.


OJ's undirected graph serialization:
Nodes are labeled uniquely.

We use # as a separator for each node, and , as a separator for node label and each neighbor of the node.
As an example, consider the serialized graph {0,1,2#1,2#2,2}.

The graph has a total of three nodes, and therefore contains three parts as separated by #.

First node is labeled as 0. Connect node 0 to both nodes 1 and 2.
Second node is labeled as 1. Connect node 1 to node 2.
Third node is labeled as 2. Connect node 2 to node 2 (itself), thus forming a self-cycle.
Visually, the graph looks like the following:

       1
      / \
     /   \
    0 --- 2
         / \
         \_/

先bfs获得所有顶点，然后先克隆顶点再克隆边。 当然还有优化的方法是两个一起克隆这样只需要走一遍。
注意重复路径问题，所以需要一边遍历一边往hashmap里面放，这样才不会导致放入重复节点。

直接一步添加完成每遍历一个neighbor就复制。

public class Solution {
    public UndirectedGraphNode cloneGraph(UndirectedGraphNode node) {
        if (node == null) {
            return null;
        }
        HashMap<UndirectedGraphNode, UndirectedGraphNode> hm = 
            new HashMap<UndirectedGraphNode, UndirectedGraphNode>();
        Queue<UndirectedGraphNode> bfs = new LinkedList<UndirectedGraphNode>();  
        // BFS to copy all the nodes
        bfs.offer(node);
        hm.put(node, new UndirectedGraphNode(node.label));
        while (bfs.size() > 0) {
            UndirectedGraphNode temp = bfs.poll();
            for (UndirectedGraphNode i : temp.neighbors) {
                if (!hm.containsKey(i)) {
                    bfs.offer(i);
                    hm.put(i, new UndirectedGraphNode(i.label));
                }
                hm.get(temp).neighbors.add(hm.get(i));
            }    
        }
        return hm.get(node);
    }
}

dfs

public class Solution {
    public UndirectedGraphNode cloneGraph(UndirectedGraphNode node) {
        HashMap<UndirectedGraphNode, UndirectedGraphNode> map = new HashMap<>();
        return copy(node, map);
    }
    
    public UndirectedGraphNode copy(UndirectedGraphNode node,
        HashMap<UndirectedGraphNode, UndirectedGraphNode> map) {
        if (node == null) {
            return null;
        }
        if (map.containsKey(node)) {
            return map.get(node);
        }
        UndirectedGraphNode newNode = new UndirectedGraphNode(node.label);
        map.put(node, newNode);
        for (UndirectedGraphNode neighbor : node.neighbors) {
            newNode.neighbors.add(copy(neighbor, map));
        }
        return newNode;
    }
